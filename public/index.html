		<h1>Lightquark</h1>
		<p>Lightquark is an open instant messaging platform, similar to Discord and Slack.</p>
		<p>Lightquark does not have an official client, and instead <a href="/developers">anyone can make their own</a> or <a href="/clients">use one created by the community</a>.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Lightquark is currently in development</span>, and new features are being added constantly. Current features include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Quarks (equivalent of servers on other platforms)</li>
			<li>Channels</li>
			<li>Message editing, deletion and replies</li>
			<li>Custom features implemented by clients, like /me, themes and more</li>
			<li>Avatars <span style="text-decoration: underline dotted lightgray;" title="Looking at you, Discord">(animated ones too, with no subscription needed)</span></li>
			<li>Authentication powered by <a href="https://auth.litdevs.org">LITauth</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Aspects that may be interesting to potential client developers:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://docs.litdevs.org">Easy to use API</a></li>
			<li>Powerful tools for custom features, such as attributes on messages</li>
			<li><a href="/developers/interoperability">Tools for interoperability with other clients</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/LITdevs/Lightquark">Open source</a>, and free to use</li>
		</ul>
